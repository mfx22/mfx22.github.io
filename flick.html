            <h3> tl;dr </h3>
            <p>Unlike many modern languages, Japanese does not utilize an adaptation that uses the English alphabet.  As a result, typing in the language on the standardized QWERTY keyboard has proven to be a struggle.  The most popular approach has been to use a keyboard cover to remap the keys to Japanese counterparts.  This is not only cumbersome but also completely unintuitive  to the language of Japanese.  Flick aims to solve this issue by simulating a more natural experience - one that uses strokes and haptic feedback to feel much more like the handwritten language.
             </p>

             <p>
               Completed during my time working at <b>Facture Product Development</b>, Flick is an early stage prototype aimed towards investors to further build the idea.  As a result, it operates as a <b>standalone unit with its own screen</b> rather than being tethered to a laptop.  It features a <b>2 axis sliding button pad with six buttons on top</b>.  Keystrokes are obtained by utilizing a combination of the button (or buttons) that are held down and the direction the keypad is flicked.   The device has a one hour battery life and has several modes of operation including writing, numbers, and TV/Alexa remote highlighting the plethora of possibilities that the device could fulfill.  The design, development, and engineering of Flick was a major stepping-stone for me into the field of product design due to the unique challenges it presented to me.

             <h3>Brainstorming and Ideation</h3>
             <img src="img/flick/IMG_0007.JPG" alt="" class="img-responsive" />
             <p>&nbsp;</p>
             <p>
               At the start of any product’s design is a no-questions-asked all-out brainstorming session.  In this we discussed everything from the user experience to the look and feel of the product to the detailed components to be used to execute the movement.  This lead to our first big design questions:
             </p>
             <ul>
              <li>How will we achieve the “flicking” motion?</li>
              <li>How will we electrically track the flick and the button presses?</li>
              <li>How will we best execute this product to its intended purpose?</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Keeping these three questions in mind, we began our journey into Flick beginning with architecture exploration.  Many important decisions had to be made.  Capacitve touch or mechanical switches?  A laptop trackpoint or a joystick?  A microcontroller or a wired device?  What microcontroller fits our specifications?  Which screen do we want?  How big will this be?  How could this be used to convey further utility?  All of these questions and more were splayed out for our team to see as we began prototyping.
            </p>


             <h3>Prototyping, Prototyping, and Prototyping some more</h3>

             <p>
               To start exploring some of these big questions about architecture, we first constructed a bare-bones prototype in order to gauge challenges and feasibility.  Though this prototype was crudely assembled with sloppy parts, it was very important.  It provided great insight into a solution that worked with the simplest and most direct path forward and exposed issues that would need to be solved in the future iterations.
             </p>

             <p>
               As we continued to test this prototype and further develop the firmware, we noticed several very important mechanical issues.  First, though the joystick we prototyped with was good for X and Y translation, it did not deal well with twisting, resulting in very noticeable wobbling when flicking, especially prominent in using the edge of the button pad.  Additionally, we realized the many challenges that would need to be eventually overcome in firmware.  There Lastly, the physical size of the system was simply too bulky for a handheld device in its current form.  With this empirical knowledge, we were able to trudge forward with some clear goals of what to work on.

               The device has two main PCBs.  The main motherboard PCB houses the 1.8” TFT screen on the front and the Feather M0 and the FFC (flexible flat cable) connector on the back.  A FFC runs between the motherboard PCB and the button pad PCB.  The button pad PCB houses the buttons on one side and joystick on the back.  A 100 mAh battery powers the device for about an hour, can be charged via the Feather’s micro USB port, and has a toggle On/Off switch.

               Device consists of two major mechanical assemblies:
             </p>
             <ul>
              <li>Device case consisting of two 3D printed parts made of nylon.  Each half was sanded and painted and the assembly was held together with screws and threaded inserts to allow for easy opening and adjusting.</li>
              <li>Keypad movement system consisting of two machined parts and four pins.  The parts are machined in aluminum for rigidity.  However, this component is a major point of cost down and simplification in the future due to current level of complexity.</li>
